Normalization is a database design process that organizes data to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing a database into smaller, related tables. This process involves defining relationships between these tables and ensuring that data is stored efficiently. The main goals of normalization are:

1.Eliminate Redundant Data: Reduce duplication of data across the database to save space and ensure consistency.
2.Ensure Data Dependencies: Maintain logical data dependencies by ensuring that only related data is stored together. This prevents anomalies during data operations (insertions, updates, deletions).
3.Improve Data Integrity: By organizing data into appropriate tables and establishing relationships, normalization helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.

Normal Forms
Normalization is usually categorized into different "normal forms" (NF). Here are the first three normal forms:

First Normal Form (1NF):

Each table has a primary key.
Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
Each entry in a column is of the same data type.
Example: A table containing multiple phone numbers in a single field violates 1NF.

Second Normal Form (2NF):

It is in 1NF.
All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key (no partial dependency).
Example: In a table where a composite key is used, all non-key attributes should depend on the entire composite key, not just part of it.

Third Normal Form (3NF):

It is in 2NF.
There are no transitive dependencies (a non-key attribute should not depend on another non-key attribute).
Example: If a table has attributes A, B, and C, and C depends on B (which is not a primary key), then the table violates 3NF.

Benefits of Normalization
Reduced Data Redundancy: Fewer duplicates in the database lead to less storage space used.
Increased Data Integrity: Changes in one part of the database automatically update related data, reducing the chance of inconsistencies.
Easier Maintenance: Smaller tables with clear relationships make it easier to manage and maintain the database.
Improved Query Performance: A well-structured database can lead to better performance in data retrieval operations.


Drawbacks of Normalization
Complex Queries: Normalization can lead to complex queries, as data may be spread across multiple tables.
Performance Overhead: In some cases, normalized databases can be slower for read-heavy operations since they require more joins.
